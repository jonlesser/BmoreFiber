      <p class="intro">Teleradiology is the use of telecommunications technology to transfer medical imaging data. Baltimore is a global leader within this field. In particular, the Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science at Johns Hopkins Hospital was the nation's top-ranked department in a 2007 survey by Medical Imaging Magazine. </p>
      <p>However, lack of bandwidth hamstrings the industry, as radiologists need to effectively analyze what can be hundreds of images, each of which may be many megabytes in size, for a single case. Further, lossy compression methodologies are not an option. As a result, patients are now frequently forced to physically carry either films or discs containing medical images, raising the risk of loss of the image or delaying care.</p>
      <p>Despite advances in sending medical images to clinicians, the primary networking issues facing the field are bandwidth, availability, and latency. Average bandwidth is the most important metric for transferring images, as radiology can be practiced without interactivity. Availability means that the data can get to any medical facility for diagnosis and analysis. Finally, as imaging applications become more interactive, low latency will become a more valuable network attribute. Google fiber will allow personal electronic health records to contain far larger data files (e.g., 3D MRI scans). They can be made available on demand, whether in the hospital, a doctor's office, or at the patient's home. A patient in an emergency room will be able to be scanned, have that scan transmitted to a radiologist at a remote site, and then receive an immediate consultation. Google fiber will improve the efficiency of healthcare, reduce costs, and save lives</p>
