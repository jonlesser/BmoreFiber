		  <p class="intro">High-speed optical fiber across Baltimore could enable new kinds of cloud computing applications to emerge. By providing citizens with applications that support distributed computating, people throughout the city could participate in important scientific research &amp;mdash; turning Baltimore into one of the largest supercomputers in the world, utilizing a shared high-speed fiberoptic bus architecture.</p>
		  <p>Cloud computing is a computing infrastructure where information and data are stored and processed through shared resources over a wide area network. Cloud computing over the Internet suffers from bandwidth bottlenecks. If high-speed optical fiber became universally available to Baltimore, new kinds of applications could emerge.</p>
		  <p>Implementing a city-wide cloud computing architecture could be a strategy for making computing and Internet access available to more people. George Soros' Open Society Institute has its only United States field office in Baltimore, and they have set aside funds to provide computing hardware to disadvantaged populations. Return on this hardware investment could be realized, in part, by including it as part of a large-scale local supercomputer &amp;mdash; and allowing citizens to explore and participate in the scientific research it enables.</p>
		  <p><strong>Charm Cloud</strong><br />
	      Distributed computing applications like &quot;SETI@home&quot; or &quot;Folding@home&quot; contribute to scientific progress by using borrowed processing time from end users throughout the Internet. For example, SETI researchers reported that typical supercomputer processing would have taken 10,000 years to do what they did in 5 years with the cheaper distributed method, SETI@home. But the future of these typical one-to-one, hub-and-spoke systems are limited. The future of distributed computing is Peer-to-Peer. Processing local information by sending it through ultrafast fiber networks could enable inexpensive computers to work at supercomputer speed. Potential applications include distributed software compiling (DistCC), parallel scientific computation (e.g., parallel numerical linear algebra), and scientific data analysis (Eureqa). Hardware configured with support for open source distributed computing applications like Boinc, Hadoop, Eucalyptus, Condor, or SLURM could enable this platform.</p>
		  <p><strong>Charm Drive</strong><br />
	      A city-wide distributed file system could be implemented using commonly available free software. Open source software such as XtreemFS or the Hadoop Distributed File System could be easily deployed as the backbone of such a service in a high-speed fiber network. Consumer and OSI-funded community machines could be imaged with a drive partition for shared use. This would enable distributed storage applications providing real-time access to a city-wide file system.</p>
		  <p>Low-cost computers powered by a special Baltimore branded version of Google Chrome OS or Linux distribution could power the future of Baltimore. Students who keep their files in Charm Cloud will have the same access from home and school. Baltimoreans could store backups to Charm Cloud with the speed of a local drive knowing that they are protected with redundancy and encrypted for privacy.</p>
		  <p>Baltimore is the ideal proving ground for the &quot;Lightning Cloud&quot; concept. City-owned conduits provide ready access to install new fiber. Baltimore has the necessary intellectual capital and skilled workforce, with centers for research in networking, cybersecurity, distributed computing, distributed storage, data-intensive scientific computation, and cloud computing for genomics. Baltimore is ready to invent the future of computing.</p>
