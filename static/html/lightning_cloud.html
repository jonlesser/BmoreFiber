      <p class="intro">With Google Fiber, Baltimore could be transformed into a giant supercomputer leveraging connected computers across the city, allowing citizens to participate in important scientific research &mdash; and help alleviate the digital divide.</p>
      <p>Distributed computing allows multiple connected inexpensive computers to perform large-scale computing tasks quickly that might otherwise require a supercomputer. Today, distributed computing using computers connected over the Internet suffers from bandwidth bottlenecks. With high-speed fiber in Baltimore, faster methods of distributed computing could allow new applications to emerge.</p>
      <p>Additionally, implementing a city-wide cloud computing architecture could be a strategy for making computers and Internet access available to more people &mdash; easing the digital divide. George Soros' Open Society Institute has its only United States field office in Baltimore.  If the Soros Fund for Poverty Alleviation provides computers to disadvantaged populations, return on this investment could be realized, in part, by connecting these computers into a city-wide supercomputing framework, allowing citizens to explore and participate in the scientific research it enables.</p>
      <p>Distributed computing applications like &quot;SETI@home&quot; or &quot;Folding@home&quot; contribute to scientific progress by using borrowed processing time from Internet users running special software. For example, SETI researchers reported that typical supercomputer processing would have taken 10,000 years to perform what was done in 5 years using SETI@home. But that model has limitations; a centralized controller must parcel work out to potentially millions of separate clients over slow connections.</p>
      <p>Using Gigabit fiber as the communications backbone, a significantly faster peer-to-peer Baltimore cloud computer could perform important research tasks like protein folding, parallel numerical computing, and computing for genomics. Additionally, a distributed storage network could be enabled, allowing instantaneous access to data across the city.</p>
      <p>Baltimore is the ideal choice for developing a city-wide computing cloud. Johns Hopkins University and University of Maryland, both global leaders in computer science, can lead the implementation, working alongside Google and our region's top experts in cyber-security to invent the future of computing.</p>
