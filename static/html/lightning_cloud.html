Leveraging grants from the Soros Fund for Poverty Alleviation, we will partner with the Open Society Institute - Baltimore to provide computers to citizens configured with applications that support distributed computation.</p>
		  <p>Cloud computing is a computing infrastructure where information and data are stored and processed through shared resources over a wide area network. Cloud computing over the Internet suffers from bandwidth bottlenecks. If high-speed optical fiber became universally available to Baltimore, new kinds of applications could emerge.</p>
		  <h4>Charm Drive</h4>
		  <p>A city-wide distributed file system could be implemented using commonly available free software. Open source software such as XtreemFS or the Hadoop Distributed File System could be easily deployed as the backbone of such a service in a high-speed fiber network. Consumer and OSI-funded community machines could be imaged with a drive partition for shared use. This would enable distributed storage applications providing real-time access to a city-wide file system. Low cost computers powered by a special Baltimore branded version of Google Chrome OS or Linux distribution could power the future of Baltimore. Students who keep their files in Charm Cloud will have the same access from home and school. Baltimoreans could store backups to Charm Cloud with the speed of a local drive knowing that they are protected with redundancy and encrypted for privacy.</p>

		  <p>Distributed computing applications like &quot;SETI@home&quot; or &quot;Folding@home&quot; contribute to scientific progress by using borrowed processing time from end users throughout the Internet. For example, SETI researchers reported that typical supercomputer processing would have taken 10,000 years to do what they did in 5 years with the cheaper distributed method, SETI@home. But the future of these typical one-to-one, hub-and-spoke systems are limited. The future of distributed computing is Peer-to-Peer. People being able to process local information by sending it through ultrafast fiber networks could enable inexpensive computers to work at supercomputer speed. Potential applications include distributed software compiling (DistCC), parallel scientific computation (e.g., parallel numerical linear algebra), and scientific data analysis (Eureqa). We propose that hardware be configured with support for open source distributed computing applications like Boinc, Hadoop, Eucalyptus, Condor, or SLURM.</p>
		  <p>Baltimore is the ideal proving ground for the &quot;Lightning Cloud&quot; concept. City-owned conduits provide ready access to install new fiber. Baltimore has the necessary intellectual capital, with centers for research in networking, distributed computing, distributed storage, data-intensive scientific computation, and cloud computing for genomics. A skilled workforce complements this intellectual base. </p>
		  <p>The Soros Fund for Poverty Alleviation has announced grants to address the &quot;Digital Divide&quot; in Baltimore. While Google lays fiber, we propose to partner with the Soros Fund and OSI-Baltimore to provide computers to low-income residents that come configured with applications that support distributed computation. The Baltimore Lightning Cloud could form as soon as fiber is connected. The Baltimore Lightning Cloud will benefit scientific research in the city and can serve as a testbed for research in distributed computing while serving the needs of our residents and helping to build a bridge across the Digital Divide.</p>
