      <p class="intro">Bob Kahn, widely recognized (along with Vint Cerf) as a father of the internet and current Chairman of the Corporation for National Resource Initiatives (CNRI) is working with the City of Baltimore to explore ways to identify subsets of municipal information which, when coupled with CNRI's Digital Object Architecture, and delivered over a Google high speed fiber network, can streamline complex government processes and deliver services online to citizens quickly and efficiently.</p>
      <p>Baltimore could be used as a testbed for application of CNRI's information management technology to the archiving of city records. During this effort, we would seek to identify and develop applications that require the kind of high bandwidth that Google Fiber will make available. Possible applications involve medical records and related health data, an education testbed involving video and advanced training technology for helping children in K-12 to learn, and multi-party collaboration and archiving techniques.</p>
      <p>The digitization of city records related to manholes and conduits offers another important and valuable opportunity to leverage Digital Object Architecture. The City of Baltimore is creating a digital repository of text, photo and video records associated with the city&rsquo;s 112 year old conduit system. This upgrade includes producing a new digital record of the contents of all 14,000 city owned manholes and creating updated digital records for the 3 million feet of city conduit. The repository will also include GIS map records of the entire conduit system. Digital Object Architecture would enable Baltimore to better archive, organize, find, securitize and preserve its disparate data. While this application does not require the high bandwidth provided by a gigabit fiber network, it would be of significant help to Google in planning and implementing the fiber network throughout the city.</p>
      <p>A collaboration between the City of Baltimore and CNRI has the potential of building a best practice for archiving and retrieving government records while creating high speed digital paths across various government silos. </p>
      <p>Although the technology has been widely used in the publishing industry and in defense applications, Baltimore would become the first city in the world to deploy CNRI's DARPA-funded technology.</p>
