      <p class="intro">A new Digital Object Architecture developed by Internet pioneer Bob Kahn can help cities find new ways to archive and share their data. With Google Fiber, Baltimore can help develop this important new technology.</p>
      <p>Bob Kahn, widely recognized (along with Vint Cerf) as a father of the Internet and current Chairman of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (<a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/index.html" target="_blank">CNRI</a>), is working with the City of Baltimore to explore ways to identify subsets of municipal information, which when coupled with CNRI's <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/papers/OverviewDigitalObjectArchitecture.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Object Architecture</a>, and delivered over a Google high-speed fiber network, can streamline complex government processes and deliver services online to citizens quickly and efficiently.  This is a scalable, secure, and also machine- and location-independent architecture &mdash; allowing archived records to outlive the systems that created them.</p>
      <p>Baltimore is exploring the use of CNRI's information management technology for archiving city records, and will identify the bandwidth-intensive applications that Google Fiber would enable.  Collaborative educational tools, healthcare-related information, and multi-party collaboration and archiving techniques are potential candidates.</p>
      <p>The digitization of city records related to manholes and conduits offers another important opportunity to leverage Digital Object Architecture. The City of Baltimore is creating a digital repository of text, photo and video records associated with the city&rsquo;s 112 year old conduit system. This upgrade includes production of a new digital record of the contents of all 14,000 city-owned manholes and creation of updated digital records for the 3 million feet of city conduit. The repository will also include GIS map records of the entire conduit system. Digital Object Architecture would enable Baltimore to better archive, organize, find, securitize and preserve its disparate data. This data would significantly accelerate Google's planning and implementation of a fiber network throughout the city.</p>
      <p>A collaboration between the City of Baltimore and CNRI has the potential of building a best practice for archiving and retrieving government records while creating high-speed digital paths across various government silos. </p>
      <p>Although the technology has been widely used in the publishing industry and in defense applications, Baltimore would become the first city in the world to deploy CNRI's DARPA-funded technology.</p>
