      <p class="intro">Telesurgery, the use of robotic or computer-integrated surgical systems to perform surgery remotely, offers several clinical advantages over conventional techniques:  better three-dimensional spatial accuracy, reliability, and precision. From a managerial perspective, it also allows health care providers to more effectively leverage the human capital of its doctors. </p>
      <p>Baltimore is a center of excellence in telesurgery.  The Johns Hopkins University is the lead institution in a partnership of universities called the <a href="http://www.cisst.org/" target="_blank">Computer-Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology Engineering Research Center</a>.  Hopkins has been a leader in this field since 1998, when a Hopkins urologist first remotely assisted (telementored) a surgeon in Rome.   Hopkins also led one of the first studies in gauging the effect of time delays on surgical performance.  More recently, a Hopkins team assisted in one of the first telesurgeries conducted over the Internet, a porcine nephrectomy.</p>
      <p>The Swirnow Mock Operating Room located at the Homewood Campus of JHU features a <a href="http://www.davincisurgery.com/" target="_blank">da Vinci Surgical System</a>, the state of the art in surgical robotics applied to minimally invasive surgery.  In addition to Johns Hopkins Hospital, four other hospitals in Baltimore City (Hopkins Bayview, Sinai, Mercy, and University of Maryland Medical Center) have da Vinci systems, as do four others in the metro area.  Baltimore is also about 40 miles east of the US Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center located at Ft. Detrick.</p>
      <p>More than other elements of telemedicine, telesurgery requires greater bandwidth due to its high-resolution, 3D stereo imaging and precision control with tactile feedback, real-time interactivity, and the criticality of procedures.  Successful telesurgery requires three attributes from its connection - bandwidth, availability of service, and latency.  Greater bandwidth (i.e., faster than T-1 speeds, the current standard) will allow a better image to be transmitted from the patient to the telesurgeon.  Quality of service, which implies both continuity and security, is necessary.  Finally, the most interesting element is latency (the delay between an action and seeing the results), which has two effects.  Connections that lag obviously make it harder for the telesurgeon to make adjustments and respond to the unexpected.  Furthermore, latency, combined with stereoscopy, can induce vertigo in the telesurgeon.</p>
      <p>Google&rsquo;s high-speed fiber connection can improve telesurgery by ensuring that the above requirements are met.  Faster bandwidth can also lead to new capabilities, such as better integration of 3-D imagery and image processing with telesurgery. </p>
      <p>As a global leader in telemedicine, high-speed, low-latency networking in Baltimore is a necessary condition for the area to provide worldwide telesurgery expertise.</p>
      <p>With DaVinci or similar systems installed in all hospital emergency rooms, one surgeon could potentially serve a patient who arrives at any hospital in the city, or even in other cities with hospitals served by fiber.  Indirect benefits include advancing the theory and practice of telesurgery and providing better training for a new generation of surgeons in this technology.</p>
