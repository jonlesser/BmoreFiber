      <p class="intro">Baltimore is a global leader in telesurgery, which requires extreme bandwidth to support high-resolution 3D stereo imaging and precise tactile feedback. With Google Fiber, Baltimore will drive a revolution in remote life-saving technology.</p>
      <p> Telesurgery is the use of telecommunications to remotely conduct surgical procedures.  It offers three clinical advantages over humans &ndash; better three-dimensional spatial accuracy, reliability, and precision.  From a managerial perspective, it also allows health care providers to more effectively leverage the human capital of its doctors.  Johns Hopkins has been a leader in this field since 1998, when a Hopkins Urologist first remotely assisted (telementored) a surgeon in Rome (Bove, et al., 2003).   Hopkins Bayview Hospital also participated in a remote varicoelectomy (Grasso, 1998).  Hopkins also led one of the first studies in gauging the effect of time delays on surgical performance (Stoianovici, et al., 1999).  More recently, a Johns Hopkins team also assisted in one of the first telesurgeries conducted over the Internet, a porcine nephrectomy using the da Vinci telesurgery robotics system (Sterbis, et al., 2008).</p>
      <p> More than other elements of telemedicine, telesurgery requires greater bandwidth due to its real-time interactivity and the criticality of procedures.  Successful telesurgery requires high-bandwidth, low latency, and a continuous and secure connection.  Increased bandwidth allows better images to be transmitted from the patient to the telesurgeon. Low latency is especially important.  Any lag in response make it harder for the telesurgeon to make adjustments and respond to the unexpected.  More insidiously, however, latency, combined with stereoscopy, can induce vertigo in the telesurgeon (Sanyal, 2006).</p>
      <p>Google&rsquo;s high-speed fiber connection can improve telesurgery by providing high-bandwidth, low-latency connections.  Faster bandwidth can also lead to new capabilities, such as better integration of 3-D imagery and image processing with telesurgery.  Google Fiber will allow the Baltimore area to share its telesurgical expertise with the world &mdash; both in terms of research and enabling doctors to save or enhance peoples' lives remotely. Furthermore, the imprimatur of organizations such as Hopkins and the University of Maryland can help spur telesurgery acceptance among the medical and regulatory communities that will control the growth of the practice.  Viewed locally, it may also help the Baltimore area medical community better integrate itself from a portfolio perspective, allowing the community to unbundle medical expertise and facility location.</p>
