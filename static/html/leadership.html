    </div>
    <div class="content-column">
      <p class="intro">The elected, corporate, educational and neighborhood leadership from across Baltimore and Maryland is committed to bringing Google Fiber to the city &mdash; and they're pledging to keep the roadblocks to a minimum.</p>
      <p>From the moment that Google published its Request for Information, Baltimore's elected representatives and community and civic leaders moved quickly to express their support for Baltimore's bid for a Google Fiber network. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Governor Martin O'Malley, Senator Barbara Mikulski, Senator Ben Cardin and the entire Baltimore City Council have all called on Google to pick Baltimore as a site to build its network. Across the city, neighborhood associations have followed suit, recognizing the potential for both local businesses and families.</p>
      <p>Baltimore's education and research leadership has joined in, too, including Baltimore Schools CEO Andr&eacute;s A. Alonso and the presidents of every college and university in the region, including Johns Hopkins University and the entire University System of Maryland. The city's extensive collection of non-profit organizations, including the Open Society Institute and the Abell Foundation, recognize that a Google Fiber network would help shape their future efforts in Baltimore's neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>And the possibility of Google Fiber coming to Baltimore has galvanized Baltimore's corporate community unlike any initiative in years. Companies that don't always see eye-to-eye on civic matters are joining this effort and asking how they can help. Not just tech companies, but major corporations in diverse industries, such as Under Armour, Constellation Energy, Legg Mason and T. Rowe Price, see the potential.</p>
      <p>From City Hall and Capitol Hill to corporate boardrooms and college campuses, the City's leaders have one message for Google: pick Baltimore, and we'll make sure that the Google network gets built quickly and efficiently.</p>
