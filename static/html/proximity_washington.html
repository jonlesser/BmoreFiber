      <p class="intro">Baltimore is uniquely positioned to serve as a &lsquo;beachhead&rsquo; for visibility and expansion of this prototype project given its location within the Northeast US Corridor and the Washington-Baltimore metro area (with the nation&rsquo;s highest concentration of IT workers). Proximity to nearby Washington, D.C. provides visibility and ready access to federal government decision-makers and regulators. The concentration of vital federal agencies in Maryland (National Security Agency, Social Security Administration, Centers for Medicaid and Medicare, National Institutes of Health and NASA) and the IT and government contractors who serve them, offers high visibility to large potential users within the region.</p>
