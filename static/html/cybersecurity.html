      <p class="intro">Proximity to and integration with local cybersecurity expertise is not a &ldquo;nice-to-have.&rdquo;  It is an essential element of any serious effort to advance the state-of-the-art in communications infrastructure.  Only a handful of cities in the world can hope to match Baltimore in this field.  None surpass it.</p>
      <p>The Baltimore region leads the world in Cybersecurity.  When Google itself was the victim of an espionage attack, it <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/02/google-seeks-nsa-help/" target="_blank">partnered with the National Security Agency</a>, headquartered at Ft. Meade in Greater Baltimore, for assistance.  Besides housing the NSA, Ft. Meade is also the proposed headquarters for US Cyber Command. The partners, contractors, and vendors that work with the NSA range from such giants as <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> itself and <a href="http://www.northropgrumman.com/" target="_blank">Northrop Grumman</a> to entrepreneurial firms like Baltimore's <a href="http://www.lgscout.com/" target="_blank">Lookingglass Cyber Solutions</a>, an emerging leader in integrating advanced visualization technology with network monitoring to create cybersecurity situational awareness.</p>
      <p>Google Fiber's effect on the creation of new cybersecurity capabilities will both extend existing technologies and enable new ones.  In the former case, cybersecurity tools and services, particularly network monitoring and management applications, can be bandwidth-intensive.  The city of Baltimore will serve as a testbed for the next generation of network monitoring and security applications.</p>
      <p>A wholly new benefit of a fiber-based network, however, will be the ability to take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution" target="_blank">quantum cryptography</a> applications out of the laboratory and develop them under real-world conditions.  Under the most common quantum cryptography application, quantum key distribution (QKD), two parties linked over a fiber optic connection use the quantum mechanical properties of photons (i.e., light) to securely create and share a key for further encryption. Undetected eavesdropping is impossible using a point-to-point QKD mechanism, as eavesdropping disrupts the quantum system within the fiber optic connection and will be noticed.  Current quantum cryptography-based networks consist of a handful of independent nodes within research institutions.  Applying QKD to a fiber optic network the size of a city would present a new range of opportunities and challenges for researchers, forcing them confront the needs of actual users.</p>
      <p>One of the more interesting effects of the advent of Google Fiber is that it is not only possible to create more powerful tools:  it is imperative to do so.  Creating a fiber-based network the size of a city could create substantial cybersecurity challenges and spur demand for more sophisticated network management and intrusion detection tools.  If Google wishes to reduce its overall project risk, then cybersecurity must play a vital role.  At the same time, the local cybersecurity industry would be able to turn its government-derived expertise to the private sector, applying their technological advances to the next wave of cybersecurity market opportunities. </p>
      <p>Implementing an unprecedented gigabit fiber optic network will mandate the use of world-class cyber-security technology. The Baltimore region is the world-leader in information security, and is uniquely qualified to help build a new, secure network with Google.</p>
