      <p class="intro">For 25 years, science operations of the Hubble Space Telescope have been overseen from Baltimore. Now, as NASA prepares to launch Hubble's next generation replacement, Google fiber could enhance the astronomical experience for the world.</p>
      <p>It's the most well-known scientific observatory in modern history. The amazing images that have made the Hubble Space Telescope the &ldquo;people&rsquo;s telescope&rdquo; originate from the Space Telescope Science Institute (<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/" target="_blank">STScI</a>) on the Johns Hopkins University campus in Baltimore. STScI offers rich media for science museums and libraries, providing a High Def video subscription service of the latest hot science topics, interactive activities for curriculum support, and a website containing visually stunning, high-resolution imagery and graphics depicting the universe (<a href="http://www.hubblesite.org" target="_blank">http://hubblesite.org</a>).</p>
      <p>In the near future, NASA will launch Hubble&rsquo;s replacement, the James Webb Space Telescope, and STScI will be the science and outreach center for the mission. This telescope will keep Baltimore on the forefront of astronomy well into the next decade. JWST will provide Baltimore with a platform to integrate high-speed networks into our established outreach efforts from the start, truly connecting people to this mission. JWST will be launched in 2014 and is expected to operate for 10 years.</p>
      <p>Direct access to high-resolution interactive astronomical imagery through tools, such as the GoogleSky browser, would leapfrog an individual&rsquo;s experience from a flat two-dimensional image to interacting with an exciting immersive 3D environment, expanding their view of their place in the expanding universe. Baltimoreans would be able to navigate through a three-dimensional model of the universe constructed from actual ground-based and space-based NASA observatories. </p>
      <p>With the introduction of Gigabit bandwidth, STScI and the JHU Physics and Astronomy Department could present a greater online presence as an academic center, providing new college-level programs and extending life-long learning experiences to an increasing number of Baltimore residents and students. Citizen science experiments in astronomy -- which have already produced new findings through such projects as the GalaxyZoo classification effort -- would have many more opportunities with Google fiber.</p>
