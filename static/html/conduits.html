      <p class="intro">Baltimore's unique, accessible, and comprehensive city-owned communication conduit system makes Baltimore the ideal location for Google to debut its advanced fiber optic network. </p>
      <p>With the introduction of the first telegraph line prior to the Civil War, Baltimore became the world's first &quot;wired&quot; city. Since the inception of the telegraph, Baltimore has carried on a tradition of providing a city-owned communications conduit system throughout the city. Today, this conduit system reaches over 90 percent of Baltimore -- allowing for the ability to architect and install fiber optic networks in optimal ring configurations throughout the city infrastructure. In Baltimore there is no need to utilize privately owned and managed aerial &ldquo;pole&rdquo; infrastructure to reach commercial centers, universities, and residences. Access to Baltimore conduit's system is open to any company that obtains a Conduit Lease Agreement from the city, for a small fee, without the need to negotiate a complicated cable TV franchise agreement. Using the City's conduit system, Google would have the ability to stage installation and roll-out of its fiber optic system according to an optimal network architecture plan to include fiber loops, node diversification, and maximum penetration levels.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is almost a complete lack of competition for true high-speed bandwidth to residences in the City of Baltimore. For example, there are less than five Verizon FIOS-equipped buildings in the city of Baltimore, and no known plan to equip any others. The typical residential Internet connection in Baltimore is a DSL connection or dial up. Baltimore is also unique in that one area of the city has a locally owned and operated independent fiber network, which was installed and is owned by residents of the area. The company, Litecast, is a strong supporter of the Baltimore Google initiative. Although it does not currently provide any residential access, Litecast's fiber network passes thousands of residences. Litecast leases dark fiber on their network and could provide a boost to Google in completing installation of the Google network. </p>
      <p>Baltimore houses world-class research institutions, public health centers, and libraries, including the University of Baltimore, the Johns Hopkins University, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and the Enoch Pratt Free Library system (the nation's oldest public library). As a result, the city has a major Internet2 Point-Of-Presence (POP) which connects many of these institutions by fiber optic cable. In fact, Baltimore is home to some of the original architects and participants of Internet2. These non-profit educational and research institutions utilize this private fiber backbone to share information and communications resources. Although a private commercial company such as Google would not be able to access the Internet2 network directly, a Google fiber network in Baltimore could be utilized as a separate bridge to this network of aggregated internet traffic for the residences of Baltimore. Baltimore is a strategic POP on the long-haul fiber network along the East Coast of the United States, which means it has several colocation and data centers including ones that are carrier neutral. In addition, Baltimore has fiber nodes that allow regional fiber connections both North and South of the city, with direct fiber connections to the major internet NAPs. The concentration of regional fiber access points and neutral colocation centers would allow Google to construct a system with diverse points of presence for optimal geographic protection against the effects of fiber cuts or damage.</p>
      <p>In the neighborhoods surrounding its world class institutions, Baltimore contains a unique concentration of residences, mixing an abundance of modern multi-tenant buildings with thousands of historic row homes. Many of the multi-tenant buildings were constructed in the last 15 years with central interior conduit systems, offering easy communications access to tenants. Baltimore's conduit system means that virtually any of its row home neighborhoods can be group captured on fiber connections through construction of &ldquo;laterals&rdquo; from the city duct work. Through the use of micro duct construction and the strategic installation of small Google vaults, Google would be able to offer fiber connectivity to any neighborhood in Baltimore independent of any other private company.</p>
