      <p class="intro">The City of Baltimore owns a robust system of conduits that is well-suited for fiber optic lines, covers ninety percent of the city area, and is ready to be leased to Google now.  Baltimore represents a unique opportunity for Google to deploy a network quickly, with no red-tape or other delays.</p>
      <p>Baltimore's unique, accessible, and comprehensive city-owned communication conduit system makes Baltimore the ideal location for Google to debut its advanced fiber optic network. </p>
      <p>With the introduction of the first telegraph line prior to the Civil War, Baltimore became the world's first &quot;wired&quot; city. Since then, Baltimore has carried on a tradition of providing a city-owned communications conduit system throughout the city. Today, this conduit system reaches over 90 percent of Baltimore &mdash; allowing for the ability to architect and install fiber optic networks in optimal ring configurations throughout the city infrastructure. In Baltimore there is no need to utilize privately owned and managed aerial &ldquo;pole&rdquo; infrastructure to reach commercial centers, universities, and residences. Access to Baltimore's conduit system is open to any company that obtains a Conduit Lease Agreement from the city, for a small fee, without the need to negotiate a cable TV franchise agreement. Using the City's conduit system, Google would have the ability to stage installation and roll-out of its fiber optic system according to an optimal network architecture plan to include fiber loops, node diversification, and maximum penetration levels.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is almost no competition for fiber optic Internet to residences in Baltimore. Most residential Internet connections are DSL or coaxial cable. One company, Litecast, operates a fiber network for its business customers, and is a strong supporter of the Baltimore Google initiative; it has dark fiber that it could provide to Google for its residential and business network. </p>
      <p>Baltimore houses world-class research institutions, public health centers, and libraries, including the University of Baltimore, the Johns Hopkins University, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and the Enoch Pratt Free Library system (one of the nation's oldest free public libraries). Because of this background, the city has a major Internet2 Point-Of-Presence (POP) which connects many of these institutions by fiber optic cable. In fact, Baltimore is home to some of the original architects and participants of Internet2.</p>
      <p>These non-profit educational and research institutions utilize this private fiber backbone to share information and communications resources. Although a for-profit company such as Google would not be able to access the Internet2 network directly, a Google fiber network in Baltimore could be bridged to this cutting-edge research network.</p>
      <p>Baltimore is also a strategic POP on the long-haul fiber network along the East Coast of the United States, which means it has several colocation and data centers including multiple carrier-neutral facilities. In addition, Baltimore has fiber nodes that allow regional fiber connections, both north and south of the city, with direct fiber connections to the major internet NAPs. The concentration of regional fiber access points and neutral colocation centers would allow Google to construct a system with diverse points of presence for optimal geographic protection against the effects of fiber cuts or damage.</p>
      <p>In the neighborhoods surrounding its world-class institutions, Baltimore contains a unique concentration of residences, mixing an abundance of modern multi-tenant buildings with thousands of historic row homes. Many of the multi-tenant buildings were constructed in the last 15 years with central interior conduit systems, offering easy access to tenants. Baltimore's conduit system means that virtually any of its row-home neighborhoods can be group-captured on fiber connections through construction of &ldquo;laterals&rdquo; from the city duct work. Through the use of microduct construction and the strategic installation of small Google vaults, Google would be able to offer fiber connectivity to any neighborhood in Baltimore, independent of any other company.</p>
