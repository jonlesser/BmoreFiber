      <p class="intro">The Baltimore region is a national leader in the development and use of &quot;serious games&quot;: interactive digital simulations with a purpose. Immersive virtual learning environments and data-intensive interactive multiplayer simulation games create new training opportunities for healthcare providers and first-responders.</p>
      <p>As the growing shortage of healthcare professionals drives up the cost of care, the demand for clinical training exceeds the capacity of traditional education with its reliance on classroom and master-apprentice teaching methods. A game-based learning platform provides total immersion training, from point-of-injury to return-to-duty status in lifelike virtual environments with dynamic virtual patients for medical personnel, or with simulated multiplayer emergencies for first-responder personnel. Game-based simulations provide an environment for meaningful, on-demand, discovery-based learning of crucial health-care expertise in controlled settings in which users can practice and refine an array of skills, including critical thinking, decision-making and differential diagnostics.</p>
      <p>The strategy gaming industry arguably got its start in Baltimore with Avalon Hill Games in 1958. From these roots came companies like Microprose (and award-winning games like Sid Meier's <em>Civilization</em>), Big Huge Games, and Firaxis. An academic center of excellence (the University of Baltimore Simulation and Digital Entertainment Program) and Homeland Security customers in Maryland and Washington, D.C. have made the Baltimore area an undisputed leader in both recreational and defense simulation game development.</p>
      <p>Breakaway Games produces the medical training platform &quot;vHealthCare&quot;, which simulates ICU cases based on Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) standards developed by the American College of Surgeons. Breakaway created Incident Commander, a 2D game-based National Incident Management System training program distributed by the Department of Justice to over 50,000 municipalities across the United States.</p>
      <p>Only gigabit fiber infrastructure will enable data-intensive, 3D stereo immersive learning environments and multiplayer crisis simulations with a greater level of realism and instant availability.</p>
