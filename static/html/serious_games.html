      <p class="intro">&quot;Serious Games&quot; use video game technology to train healthcare providers, first-responders, and soldiers. With Google Fiber, Baltimore will make these data-intensive environments more immersive and effective, ultimately saving lives.</p>
      <p>Healthcare providers, first responders, and soldiers must make tough decisions quickly and under pressure, requiring situational awareness and acuity. &quot;Serious games&quot; are interactive digital simulations that provide immersive virtual learning environments that can help train for these skills in a controlled setting.</p>
      <p>In healthcare, clinical training increasingly requires the use of immersive new technology. Using game-based learning platforms, students can experience everything from point-of-injury to release in lifelike virtual environments, with dynamic virtual patients for medical personnel.  First responders can experience real-world emergencies with life-like graphics and sound.  Game-based simulations permit on-demand, discovery-based, learning of crucial expertise in controlled settings.  Users can practice and refine an array of skills, including critical thinking, decision-making and differential diagnostics.</p>
      <p>The modern strategy gaming industry arguably got its start in Baltimore with Avalon Hill Games in 1958, followed by such companies as Microprose (and award-winning games like Sid Meier's Civilization), Big Huge Games, and Firaxis.  These companies, together with an academic center of excellence, the University of Baltimore Simulation and Digital Entertainment Program; and Federal customers in Maryland and Washington, D.C., have made the Baltimore area an undisputed leader in recreational and defense simulation game development.  Breakaway Games produces the medical training platform &quot;vHealthCare&quot;, which simulates ICU cases based on Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) standards developed by the American College of Surgeons. Breakaway also created Incident Commander, a 2D game-based National Incident Management System training program distributed by the Department of Justice to over 50,000 municipalities across the United States.</p>
      <p>With Google Fiber, Baltimore will extend its leadership in serious game development to make data-intensive, 3D-stereo immersive learning environments and multiplayer crisis simulations even more realistic and ubiquitous.</p>
