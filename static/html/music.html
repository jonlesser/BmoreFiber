      <p>In 2008 Rolling Stone Magazine named Baltimore the best music scene in the nation &mdash; &quot;a hotbed for rap and art rock.&quot; Baltimore's &quot;High Zero&quot; festival is the leading experimental improvised music event in the nation. Nurturing and expanding these creative resources will help continue Baltimore's preeminence. However, the industry suffers from a lack of bandwidth. Current broadband is far too slow to transfer or remix audio files effectively, either in the studio, across computing clouds, or onto personal computing platforms. Currently, you have to physically move audio files using portable hard drives or wait &mdash; sometimes hours &mdash; to transfer them via FTP. You cannot perform or collaborate over the Internet in real time, as the connection speed cannot keep up with the demands of digital audio capture.</p>
      <p>This is especially important in indie music, as many singers, songwriters and musicians record on inexpensive home digital-audio workstations like Logic, Ableton, and Pro Tools, then share audio files with collaborators, producers, and larger studios for additional production and mixing. Currently, this process is burdensome, time-consuming and a drag on the creative process.</p>
      <p>Google Fiber will usher in a whole new era of collaboration and innovation. For example, two singers could record a duet while in different studios across town or across the world. A bass player could lay down a track remotely with a drummer in another city. Two composers could record and work remotely via video chat. The potential for creativity, innovation and collaboration in music is immense.</p>
      <p>Bringing Google Fiber to Baltimore will create more opportunities for the independent music industry, in a scene that is already flourishing.</p>
