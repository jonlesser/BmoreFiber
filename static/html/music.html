      <p class="intro">Baltimore is home to one of the most creative and innovative independent music scenes in the country, as well as the world-famous Peabody Institute. With Google Fiber, we will push musical innovation to new frontiers.</p>
      <p>In 2008 Rolling Stone Magazine named Baltimore the best music scene in the nation &mdash; &quot;a hotbed for rap and art rock.&quot; Baltimore's &quot;<a href="http://www.highzero.org/" target="_blank">High Zero</a>&quot; festival is the leading experimental improvised music event in the nation. And Baltimore is home to the renowned Peabody Institute, a conservatory and preparatory school with more than 2,000 students.</p>
      <p>With Gigabit Internet, Baltimore can push the limits of music even further. It would enable transfer and remix of audio files and live performances between studios or to the public. Currently, musicians must use portable hard drives or wait, sometimes hours, to transfer them via FTP.  You cannot perform or collaborate over the Internet in real time, as the connection speed cannot keep up with the demands of digital audio capture.</p>
      <p>High-speed connections would especially impact independent singers, songwriters and musicians, as they often record on inexpensive home digital-audio workstations like Logic, Ableton, and Pro Tools, and then share audio files with collaborators, producers, and larger studios for additional production and mixing. Currently this process is burdensome, and time-consuming, hampering the creative process.</p>
      <p>Google Fiber will usher in a whole new era of collaboration and innovation in Baltimore. For example, two singers could record a duet while in different studios across town or across the world. A bass player could lay down a track remotely with a drummer in another city. Two composers could record and work remotely via video chat. The potential for creativity, innovation and collaboration in music, particularly here in Baltimore, is immense.</p>
