      <p class="intro">The Walters Art Museum is digitizing its unique collection of rare manuscripts, including the stunning Archimedes Palimpsest. With Google Fiber, the Walters can accelerate its ambitious program to share these treasures with the world.</p>
      <p> Using one of the world's most advanced document imaging labs, Baltimore's Walters Art Museum is working to share its massive collection of ancient texts with the world under a Creative Commons license. Scans of ancient codexes once lost to the public would be free to view by anyone at home. Google's fiber network would connect scholars around the world to these priceless assets.</p>
      <p>The Walters is home to a wide variety of rare manuscripts, from copies of the Koran, to a 13th-century Armenian Christian gospel, to one of the most famous surviving ancient texts &mdash; the Archimedes Palimpsest. That book, from the famous ancient mathematician Archimedes, laid out the principles of Calculus a thousand years before Sir Issac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz were born.</p>
      <p>For thousands of years, these books have been closed to almost everyone. At the Walters, each of these texts is now being recorded using advanced multi-spectral imaging &mdash; eventually opening them to people around the world through the Internet.</p>
      <p>Currently available Internet infrastructure is too slow to allow ready access to these tomes. Each page generates at least twenty-three 39-megapixel, 1.8 gigabyte images, crucial for scholars to read the almost invisible lost texts. Multiply that by hundreds of pages and a single manuscript can exceed one-terabyte. How does the Walters staff currently move this data? By carrying or shipping hard drives filled with data!</p>
      <p>With a Google fiber network, these preservation and research efforts at the Walters would be accelerated dramatically, bringing these beautiful images &mdash; and the understanding their study enables  &mdash; to the entire world.</p>
