      <p class="intro">Using one of the world's most advanced document imaging labs, Baltimore's Walters Art Museum is working to share its massive collection of ancient texts with the world as Creative Commons licensed works. Scans of ancient codexes once lost to the public would be free to view by anyone at home. Google's fiber network would assist in providing the much needed infrastructure to connect the research to scholars around the world.</p>
      <p>The Walters Art Museum in downtown Baltimore is home to a wide variety of ancient manuscripts, from a gospel book made in Armenia in the 13th century, to one of the most famous surviving ancient texts, the Archimedes Palimpsest. That book from the famous ancient Mathematician Archimedes laid out the principles of Calculus a thousand years before Sir Issac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz were even born. For thousands of years, these books have been closed to almost everyone. At the Walters, each of these texts is now being recorded in one of the world's most advanced manuscript multi-spectral imaging labs &mdash; eventually opening these books to people around the world on the Internet.</p>
      <p>But sadly, the current Internet infastructure of Baltimore falls short of what is needed to allow full speed access to these tomes from the Walters. Recording each page requires extremely high-resolution images, crucial for scholars to read the almost invisible lost texts. Taking 23 images with a 39-megapixel camera creates 1.8 GBs of data per page of manuscript. Multiply that by the hundreds of pages of a text, and even a 1-terabyte drive begins to fill for only one Ancient text. How does the Walters staff currently share the data of these books through out the world? SneakerNet!</p>
      <p>With a Google fiber network, the manuscript preservation and study efforts at the Walters Art Museum could increase exponentially. No longer would so much time at the museum be spent on copying hard drives for shipment around the world. And so many more images from these ancient texts could be shared over the Internet with Baltimore and the world.</p>
